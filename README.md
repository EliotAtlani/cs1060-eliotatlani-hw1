- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time validation with efficient constraint checking
- **Move History**: Complete game state management with branching undo/redo

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:
- **Core Sudoku Logic**: Board validation, constraint checking, utilities
- **Puzzle Generation**: Uniqueness verification, difficulty scaling, seed consistency  
- **Solver Algorithms**: Technique correctness, step-by-step solving, edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run test:ui   # Run tests with UI
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üéØ Gameplay Tips

### For Beginners
1. Start with **Easy** difficulty to learn the basics
2. Use **Notes mode** (Space key) to track possible numbers
3. Look for cells with only one possible number (**Single Candidate**)
4. Check each row, column, and 3x3 box for missing numbers (**Hidden Single**)

### Advanced Techniques  
1. **Naked Pairs**: When two cells in the same unit can only contain the same two numbers
2. **Pointing Pairs**: When a number in a box is restricted to one row/column
3. **Box-Line Reduction**: When a number in a row/column is restricted to one box
4. **X-Wing**: Advanced pattern involving four cells forming a rectangle

### Using Hints Effectively
- Use hints sparingly to maintain challenge
- Read hint explanations to learn new techniques
- Practice identified techniques in future games
- Try to solve without hints for perfect games
